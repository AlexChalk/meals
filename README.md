# Meals

A very simple exercise that introduced me to collaborating on github. I added a partner as a collaborator, and we each took turns fetching, merging, editing, committing, and pushing the `meals.txt` file. 

Created as part of the Makers Academy Bootcamp. For more information on Makers Academy, see their homepage [here](http://www.makersacademy.com).
